	<h1>Persona</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Name:</strong>Danielle</li>
		<li><strong>Age:</strong>32</li>
		<li><strong>Profession/Role:</strong>A biologist who enrolled and graduated from deep dive bootcamp as a full-stack
		developer. Currently tutors a student from the cohort in progress. Is proficient in html,css, bootstrap, mysql, and php. Also does photography and can work in
		adobe web design products, Photoshop and illustrator. She also develops websites for her own clients</li>
		<li><strong>Technology:</strong> Pc laptop, slack, Smartphone, internet she is most comfortable communicating with students through slack
		</li>
		<li><strong>Behavior and Attitudes:</strong> She's new to tutoring. But she has the experience of being fresh out
		of coding bootcamp. Right now she doesn't ask directly for a rate she just takes what's given to her.
		She's available for tutoring at the most, three days a week and her sessions usually last 1-2hours.Not looking at tutoring as a fulltime
		job, but something to add to income and enrich her own understanding of coding. Very easy to work with and she is proactive. She makes constant
		check ups on her students and is available for any questions or concerns beyond the tutoring session. Her tutoring style is not really planned because of
		the nature of the bootcamp. She usually expands on what the student is most concerned with. And she likes to confirm that they fully have an understanding of
		a topic before she ends her sessions</li>
		<li><strong>Goal:</strong>Not to necessarily get as many people to tutor as possible  but atleast on the the three days she has available to get more than one student. Shes open to tutoring multiple students at the same time.
		Give her the options to have a set price as a pre-condition.</li>
		<li><strong>Frustrations:</strong> Setting definite and routine appointments doesn't really work well as it is. Also finding a central location to study with
		wifi that is open late can also prove difficult.</li>
		<li><strong>User Story:</strong>As a user, I need a way to set appointments within my avialble schedule, reach out to more  students and have a formal way to ask for pyments or rates.</li>

		<h2>UseCase</h2>
		Daniel just getting out of this coding bootcamp less than a month ago, has started tutoring and deep dive bootcamp. She has all the technology needed to communicate with the student,
		and can use her computer as a work station. The thing that is lacking is an official approach to reaching the students. Whether that be through physical locations  with wifi and are open late. to meet or follow through after
		the initial tutoring session. She doesnt have an asking price and would like an official way to do this. She doesnt have the desire to tutor fulltime, but on the days she is limited to
		she would like to schedule as many as possible.
