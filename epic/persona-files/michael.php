		wife he has decided to change careers. After months of research and thought he decides web developement is a great
		field that can offer him and his family just what he is looking for. He began looking into to schools and stumbled
		upon the full stack bootcamp at CNM's Stemulus center. After seeing some of the success stories associated with the
		bootcamp and noting many of the Alumni had zero to minimal coding experience he dicided this was the course for him.

		has no problem on his phone</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes:</strong>Michael has a very positive no quit attitude. when faced with adversity he always goes
		the extra mile and seeks out any extra resources necessary to complete his goals.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations:</strong>Michael is frustrated with the lack of sleep and family time he has gotten in the
		first 3 weeks of the bootcamp. He is begining to get frustrated with himself as he feels he is not getting a grasp
		on the curriculum. Feeling the pressure he decides to look for other resources. He begins watching youtube videos,
		reading, even listening to podcasts on the way to school in the morning. After spending many hours trying to learn
		on his own he decides to look into getting one on one tutoring in hopes that a more hands on approach will help him
		more.</p>
		<p><Strong>Goals:</Strong> Michael want's to alleviate some of the dead hours he has spent trying to teach
		himself by hiring a tutor. He is looking for a tutor that can meet 2 or 3 times a week for 2 hours. Michael
		is hoping to get more sleep and time with his family as well as a firm grasp on all he is learning.</p>
		<p><strong>Use Case:</strong></p>At the end of Thursday's OOP Lecture it was open work time. Michael remembered
		+		back to orientation day when the instructors were explaining all the resources available to the students one of the
		+		things that stuck out was one of the previous capstones "Deep Dive Tutor". Michael decided to ask the instructor
		+		how the process works. It was explained to Michael that the website was very easy to navigate and there would be step
		+		by step instructions on how to sign and up and be assigned to a tutor that would work best for him. Now its lunch time
		+		and Michael decides to give it a try. When the site first opens he is met with a welcome page and some words of
		+		encouragement, he is assured the sign up process would be one simple step that confirms he is a deep dive student.
		+		After signing up he is asked to explain the problems he is having and what languages he needs the most help with. He
		+		is then asked to fill out a questionnaire with his availability, location he wants to meet, contact information and
		+		the amount he is looking to spend on a tutor. He then clicks submit and he is assigned a tutor. Michael is told he
		+		will be contacted by his tutor no later than the end of the following day.
